### Juju

The charm supports several Juju releases from [2.9 LTS](https://juju.is/docs/juju/roadmap#juju-juju-29) onwards. The table below shows which minor versions of each major Juju release are supported by the stable Charmhub releases of MySQL. 
> Always check the [charm release notes](/t/11881) to find the minimum Juju version for your deployment.

| Juju major release | Supported minor versions | Compatible charm revisions |Comment |
|:--------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| ![3.6 LTS] | `3.6.1+` | 325+ |     |
| ![3.5] | `3.5.2+` | [240]+ |     |

See the guide [How to upgrade Juju for a new database revision](/t/14325).

### MySQL Group replication requirements
* In order to integrate with this charm, every table created by the integrated application **must have a primary key**. This is required by the [group replication plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-requirements.html) enabled in this charm.
* The count of [Charmed MySQL units](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication-limitations.html) in a single Juju application is limited to 9. Unit 10+ will start; however, they will not join the cluster but sleep in a hot-swap reserve.

## Hardware

Make sure your machine meets the following requirements:
- 8GB of RAM.
- 2 CPU threads.
- At least 20GB of available storage.

The charm is based on the [charmed-mysql snap](https://snapcraft.io/charmed-mysql). It currently supports:
* `amd64`
* `arm64` (from revision 274+)

 [Contact us](/t/11867) if you are interested in new architecture!

## Networking
* Access to the internet for downloading the required snaps and charms.
  * For air-gapped environments, see our [offline deployment guide](/t/15747)
* Only IPv4 is supported at the moment
  * See more information about this limitation in [this Jira issue](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/DPE-4695)
  * [Contact us](/t/11867) if you are interested in IPv6!
