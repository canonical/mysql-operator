# Enable encryption with TLS

[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a protocol used to encrypt data exchanged between two applications. Essentially, it secures data transmitted over a network.

Typically, enabling TLS internally within a highly available database or between a highly available database and client/server applications requires a high level of expertise. This has all been encoded into Charmed MySQL so that configuring TLS requires minimal effort on your end.

TLS is enabled by integrating Charmed MySQL with the [Self Signed Certificates Charm](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates). This charm centralises TLS certificate management consistently and handles operations like providing, requesting, and renewing TLS certificates.

In this section, you will learn how to enable security in your MySQL deployment using TLS encryption.

```{caution}
**[Self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) are not recommended for a production environment.**

Check [this guide](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/11664) for an overview of the TLS certificates charms available. 
```

## Enable TLS
To enable TLS on Charmed MySQL, we must deploy the `self-signed-certificates` charm and integrate it with MySQL.

### Deploy TLS charm
Deploy the `self-signed-certificates` TLS charm with the following command:
```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates --config ca-common-name="Tutorial CA"
```

Wait until `self-signed-certificates` is up and active, using `juju status --watch 1s` to monitor its progress:
```shell
Model     Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp

6        started  10.234.188.19   juju-ff9064-6  focal       Running
```

### Integrate with MySQL

To enable TLS on Charmed MySQL, integrate the two applications:
```shell
juju integrate mysql self-signed-certificates
```
MySQL is now using TLS certificate generated by the `self-signed-certificates` charm.

#### Check the TLS certificate in use
Use `openssl` to connect to MySQL and check the TLS certificate in use:
```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.234.188.135:3306 | grep Issuer
...
depth=1 C = US, CN = self-signed-certificates-operator
...
```

## Disable TLS
To remove the external TLS and return to the locally generate one, remove the integration from the applications:
```shell
juju remove-relation mysql self-signed-certificates
```

If you once again check the TLS certificates in use via the OpenSSL client, you will see something similar to the output below:

```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.234.188.135:3306 | grep Issuer
```

```shell
...
depth=1 CN = MySQL_Server_8.0.32_Auto_Generated_CA_Certificate
...
```
The Charmed MySQL application reverted to the placeholder certificate that was created locally during the MySQL server installation.
