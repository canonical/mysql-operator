# Enable encryption with TLS

This is part of the [Charmed MySQL Tutorial](/t/9922). Please refer to this page for more information and the overview of the content.

[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a protocol used to encrypt data exchanged between two applications. Essentially, it secures data transmitted over a network.

Typically, enabling TLS internally within a highly available database or between a highly available database and client/server applications requires a high level of expertise. This has all been encoded into Charmed MySQL so that configuring TLS requires minimal effort on your end.

TLS is enabled by integrating Charmed MySQL with the [Self Signed Certificates Charm](https://charmhub.io/self-signed-certificates). This charm centralises TLS certificate management consistently and handles operations like providing, requesting, and renewing TLS certificates.

In this section, you will learn how to enable security in your MySQL deployment using TLS encryption.

[note type="caution"]
**[Self-signed certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate) are not recommended for a production environment.**

Check [this guide](/t/11664) for an overview of the TLS certificates charms available.

### Configure TLS
Before enabling TLS on Charmed MySQL we must first deploy the `self-signed-certificates` charm:
```shell
juju deploy self-signed-certificates --config ca-common-name="Tutorial CA"
```

Wait until the `self-signed-certificates` is up and active, use `juju status --watch 1s` to monitor the progress:
```shell
Model     Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
tutorial  overlord    localhost/localhost  2.9.42   unsupported  00:40:42+01:00

```

### Add external TLS certificate
To enable TLS on Charmed MySQL, integrate the two applications:
```shell
juju integrate mysql self-signed-certificates
```

#### Check the TLS certificate in use:
Use `openssl` to connect to the MySQL and check the TLS certificate in use:
```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.234.188.135:3306 | grep Issuer
...
depth=1 C = US, CN = self-signed-certificates-operator
...
```
Congratulations! MySQL is now using TLS certificate generated by the external application `self-signed-certificates`.


### Remove external TLS certificate
To remove the external TLS and return to the locally generate one, unrelate applications:
```shell
juju remove-relation mysql self-signed-certificates
```

#### Check the TLS certificate in use:
```shell
> openssl s_client -starttls mysql -connect 10.234.188.135:3306 | grep Issuer
```
The output should be similar to:
```shell
...
depth=1 CN = MySQL_Server_8.0.32_Auto_Generated_CA_Certificate
...
```
The Charmed MySQL application reverted to the placeholder certificate that was created locally during the MySQL server installation.
