# Deploy Charmed MySQL

In this section, you will deploy Charmed MySQL, access a unit, and interact with the MySQL databases that exist inside the application.

  * [ Access MySQL via the `mysql` client](#access-mysql-via-the-mysql-client)

## Deploy MySQL

To deploy Charmed MySQL, run the following command:
```shell
juju deploy mysql
```

Juju will now fetch Charmed MySQL from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/mysql) and deploy it to the LXD cloud. This process can take several minutes depending on how provisioned (RAM, CPU, etc) your machine is. You can track the progress by running:
```shell
juju status --watch 1s
```

>This command is useful for checking the real-time information about the state of a charm and the machines hosting it. Check the [`juju status` documentation](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-status) for more information about its usage.

When the application is ready, `juju status` will show the `mysql` app as `active` and the `mysql/0*` unit as `idle`, like the example below:
```shell
Model      Controller  Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp
tutorial   overlord    localhost/localhost  3.5.2    unsupported  00:52:59+02:00

App    Version          Status  Scale  Charm  Channel     Rev  Exposed  Message
mysql  8.0.32-0ubun...  active      1  mysql  8.0/stable  151  no       Primary

Unit      Workload  Agent  Machine  Public address  Ports           Message
mysql/0*  active    idle   1        10.234.188.135  3306,33060/tcp  Primary

Machine  State    Address         Inst id        Base          AZ  Message
1        started  10.234.188.135  juju-ff9064-0  ubuntu@22.04      Running
```

> To exit the screen with `juju status --watch 1s`, enter `Ctrl+C`.

You can also watch juju logs with the [`juju debug-log`](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-debug-log) command. More info on logging in the [juju logs documentation](https://juju.is/docs/olm/juju-logs).

## Access MySQL
[note type="caution"]
**Warning:** This part of the tutorial accesses MySQL via the `root` user. 

**Do not directly interface with the `root` user in a production environment.**

In a [later section about integrations](/t/9916), we will cover how to safely access MySQL via a separate user.
[/note]

 The easiest way to access MySQL is via the [MySQL Command-Line Client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) (`mysql`). For this, we must first retrieve the credentials.

### Retrieve credentials
Connecting to the database requires that you know the values for `host` (IP address), `username` and `password`. 

To retrieve `username` and `password`, run the [Juju action](https://juju.is/docs/juju/action) `get-password` on the leader unit as follows:
```shell
juju run mysql/leader get-password
```
Example output:
```shell
...
password: yWJjs2HccOmqFMshyRcwWnjF
username: root
```

To request a password for a different user, use the option `username`:
```shell
juju run mysql/leader get-password username=<username>
```

To retrieve the host’s IP address, run `juju status`. This should be listed under the "Public address" of the unit hosting the MySQL application:
```shell
...
Unit      Workload  Agent  Machine  Public address  Ports  Message
mysql/0*  active    idle   1        10.234.188.135  3306,33060/tcp  Primary
...
```

### Access MySQL via the `mysql` client

To access the unit hosting Charmed MySQL, one could normally use the following command:

```
mysql -h <ip_address> -u<username> -p<password>
```

However, this is not possible with the `root` user. For security reasons, the `root` user is restricted to only allow connections from localhost. 

The way to access MySQL server with the `root` user is to first ssh into the primary Juju unit:
```shell
juju ssh mysql/leader
```
> In this case, we know the primary unit is the [juju leader unit](https://juju.is/docs/juju/leader), since it is the only existing unit. 
>
> In a cluster with more units, **the primary is not necessarily equivalent to the leader**. To identify the primary unit in a cluster, run `juju run mysql/<any_unit> get-cluster-status`. This will display the entire cluster topology.

Once inside the Juju virtual machine, the `root` user can access MySQL by calling
```
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -pyWJjs2HccOmqFMshyRcwWnjF
```
> Remember, your password will be different to the example above. Make sure to insert it without a space as `-p<password>`

You will then see the `mysql>` command prompt, similar to the output below:
```none
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 56
Server version: 8.0.32-0ubuntu0.22.04.2 (Ubuntu)

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

> If at any point you'd like to leave the mysql client, enter `Ctrl+D` or type `exit`.

You can now interact with MySQL directly using any [MySQL Queries](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/entering-queries.html). For example entering `SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;` should output something like:
```shell
mysql> SELECT VERSION(), CURRENT_DATE;
+-------------------------+--------------+
| VERSION()               | CURRENT_DATE |
+-------------------------+--------------+
| 8.0.32-0ubuntu0.22.04.2 | 2023-01-29   |
+-------------------------+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Feel free to test out any other MySQL queries. 

>When you’re ready to leave the mysql shell you can just type `exit`. Once you've typed `exit` you will be back in the host of Charmed MySQL (`mysql/0`). Exit this host by once again typing `exit`. Now you will be in your original shell where you first started the tutorial; here you can interact with Juju and LXD.
