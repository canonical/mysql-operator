# MySQL Machine Charmed Operator

## Description

The [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) operator provides an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). This repository contains a Juju Charm for deploying MySQL on machines.

This charm is currently in development, with High Availability via Group Replication as a short-term goal.

## Usage

To deploy this charm using Juju 2.9.0 or later, run:

```shell
juju add-model mysql
charmcraft pack
juju deploy ./mysql_ubuntu-20.04-amd64.charm mysql
```

Note: the above model must exist outside of a k8s environment (you could bootstrap an lxd environment).

To confirm the deployment, you can run:

```shell
juju status --color
```

Once MySQL starts up, it will be running on the default port (3306).

If required, you can remove the deployment completely by running:

```shell
juju destroy-model -y mysql --destroy-storage
```

Note: the `--destroy-storage` will delete any data persisted by MySQL.
